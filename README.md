# Object-Oriented-Programming-Basic-Project
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to structure code, allowing for modularity, reusability, and encapsulation of data and behavior.
This repository provides an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and practices. OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes modular, reusable, and maintainable code by organizing it around objects. This readme serves as a guide to understanding the fundamental principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It also covers key design patterns and SOLID principles for creating robust and flexible software architectures. Explore the code samples, explanations, and resources provided here to grasp the power of OOP and enhance your programming skills. Start building efficient and scalable applications with OOP today!
